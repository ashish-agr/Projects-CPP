A simple console based Hangman game made with C++. 
# Instructions
1. Choose word file to use for game based on if you are play testing or actually trying out the game.
  a. First file contains 120+ words, difficult to guess.
  b. Second file contains 6 words, easy to guess.
2. You will only know the number of letters of the word to be guessed, and you need to start typing in upper case alphabets and hope you get a hint of the word you need to guess.
3. Try to guess the entire word before the Hangman is finished.

Note: Once an alphabet is put in, it doesn't count if you type it again. This thus gives you a total of 10 "different" alphabets to guess before the game ends.
